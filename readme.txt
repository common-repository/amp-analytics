== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure Google Analytics tracking for AMP? =

It's very important that you first create a separate [property](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/1009620) for AMP content.

Once you have a separate property, then add the [Tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032385) to `Settings > AMP Analytics` to start tracking AMP content.
